“KPatience Solving a FreeCell Deal Automatically”

<blockquote>

A demo of KPatience ( https://games.kde.org/game.php?game=kpat ) solving
Freecell using the solver ( https://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ ). While I
prepared recordings of PySol, kpat seems to move the cards faster and may
have a more attractive look.
